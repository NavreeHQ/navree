# Changelog

Every change to Navree is listed here, newest first. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Navree follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Every crate and
every `@navree/*` package carries the same version.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-11

### Fixed

- `navree dev` on Linux restarted the server again and again with nothing edited: it took a file
  being opened or read (the server reading `.env` as it starts, `cargo build` reading `Cargo.toml`)
  for an edit. Only edits start a rebuild now, and a server busy writing `storage/` no longer delays one.

### Security

- The development install of `@navree/nuxt` takes node-forge 1.4.3, for the four advisories fixed in it.
  Only Nuxt's development HTTPS certificates use it; the published package does not depend on it.
- The fuzzing workspace takes rustix 1.1.6, for RUSTSEC-2026-0486; the main workspace already had it.

### Changed

- Dependencies: the minor and patch updates of the Rust crates and of the front-end packages.
